Branches are usually used for testing out new features without breaking a working version of the program.Since branches don â€™ t affect each other states,
the new branch can be played with without worrying about other ones.
this is the good way to edit it,
i am going to changes every thing,
and thus the new features will be published.For now it suffices to understand that we will only use the main branch in the exercises.

(<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>).
The content between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= represents your local changes, and the content between ======= and >>>>>>> represents the changes from the remote.
