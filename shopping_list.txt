In order to share a project through GitHub,
a repository (
    or simply a repo
) has to be created for it,
and it has to be linked to a local Git project.
After a remote repository has been added to a project,
    information can be shared between them.In consequence,
    two concurrent versions of the project will exist: the remote in GitHub
    and a local version on a specific computer.This shows how GitHub functions as a backup storage.
    When the state of a project is updated to its remote in GitHub,
    it can be accessed
from anywhere with internet.Thus the project can be continued even if its local version is destroyed
    or damaged.You can create a repository to GitHub by pressing the button on the upper right corner:
